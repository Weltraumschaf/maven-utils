# PR validator: This script will checkout Maven, apply a PR, build the Maven distribution and
#               run the Maven integration tests against the just-built distribution. If you
#               successfully get to the end of this script then your PR is ready to be reviewed.

# Assumptions:
# 1) You have a functioning version of Maven installed (script tested with 3.2.1)
# 2) You have a decent connection. This script checks out everything from scratch and downloads
#    everything into a clean local repository. Not terribly efficient but makes sure there is no
#    interference from previous Maven operations.
#
# This really serves as a set of instructions to test your changes. Once you see what's required you
# can setup things as you wish, but this will get you started. I have maven and maven-integration-testing
# in sibling directories and iterate through a process of building Maven, installing the distribution and
# running the integration tests. This really just shows you where all the bits are.
#
# To use use this save it to a file called maven-pr-validator.sh and run it using the PR# like the following:
#
# ./maven-pr-validator 16
#
# For use with a corresponding maven-integration-test PR# like:
# ./maven-pr-validator.sh 70 14
